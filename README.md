<p>1.</ul>
<p>Im trying to target the 4 questions button to make them visible, but it does not work.</p><p>Will update this:
<li>Curretly trying to change the href path to javascript inside the game.html file, aswell as the script src path on line 51 inside game.html</p>
<ul>Changed from src="style.css" to src="assets/css/style.css"</ul>
<li>It didn't fix the targeting bug.
<li>Update: I have fixed the issue, it seems there was a spelling misstake on the file paths.
